For that reason we chose not to use the Delta subset.  Virgin America has a good distribution, but also has a very limited number of tweets.  For these reasons we chose Southwest as this subset has the least skewed distribution of positive/negative/neutral tweets (after Virgin America and Delta/JetBlue) while still having a resonable number of tweets.  Tweets were also re-indexed starting at 0 which is important so that they can be identified later when we print a tweet from each cluster."
